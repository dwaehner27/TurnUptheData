## Final Results

Here is our teams recommendation for Turn Up The Data Co. to create the next musical hit.

Ideally the song should have the following components as a starting point:

* Acousticness should be greater than 0.5 range after a crisis. Less than 0.5 if there are no major events during that year.
* Energy should be in the from 0.6 to 0.8 range
* Instrumentalness should be in the 0.1 to 0.2 range
* Key should be in the 0.4 range
* Loudness should be in the -0.5 to 0.25 range
* Speechiness should be in the 0.2 range

As a team, we found out that there is sufficient statistical evidence that proves there is a relationship bewteen this song components and the songs popularity.

If the company decides to go with a more conservative approach (wanting their song to be in the 65% to 75% popularity ratings) they can have these starting points for the song components:

* Acousticness 0.5
* Energy 0.5
* Instrumentalness 0.08
* Key 4.7
* Loudness -9.91
* Speechiness 0.06
